# ITI 9-Month Program - C Programming Tasks

This repository contains my solutions for the C programming tasks completed during the Introduction to Programming course, which is part of the Web & User Interface Development track at ITI (Information Technology Institute).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day's tasks in separate directories:

```
C-Programming-Tasks/
├── Day1/
│   ├── Task1/
│   ├── Task2/
│   └── ...
├── Day2/
│   ├── Task1/
│   ├── Task2/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Each task is a separate CodeBlocks project containing the source code and project files.

## Prerequisites

To run these tasks, you'll need:
- CodeBlocks IDE (recommended version: 17.12)
- GCC compiler
- Windows operating system

## How to Run the Tasks

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DWN11311/prog-intro-iti.git
   ```

2. Open CodeBlocks IDE

3. To run a specific task:
   - Navigate to the desired day and task directory
   - Open the `.cbp` (CodeBlocks Project) file
   - Click Build & Run (F9) or just Run (Ctrl + F10)

## Course Overview

This collection represents 7 days of intensive C programming training.
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures
- Functions
- Arrays
- Strings
- Structures
- Interactive Console Apps
- Pointers
- Dynamic Allocation

## Notes

- Each project is self-contained with its own build configuration
- Some tasks may seem incomplete as the code was reused and improved in later tasks (e.g., the LineEditor task from Days 5 & 6 does not include backspace handling, which was later added in Day 7's MultiLineEditor)

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the tasks or need clarification.
